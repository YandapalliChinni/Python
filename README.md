#My Projects. This project features two clock styles: analog and digital. The analog clock, created using Turtle graphics, offers a classic representation with real-time hour, minute, and second hands. Colorful and aesthetically pleasing, it provides an interactive visual experience. The digital clock, built with Tkinter, presents the time in a clear 12-hour format with AM/PM indicators on a large display. Users can select their preferred style, making this project an engaging way to monitor time, offering both traditional charm and modern convenience.
